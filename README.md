### Front-End Architect & Interface Designer

### 🧬 THE PHILOSOPHY
I don't just write code; I build digital experiences. My approach to development is rooted in three core pillars that go beyond what you'll see on my LinkedIn:

* **Performance First:** Fast load times and 60fps transitions are non-negotiable.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Writing clean, modular **TypeScript** that stays maintainable as the project grows.
* **Pixel Perfection:** Bridging the gap between Figma designs and production code with 1:1 accuracy.

### 📡 CONNECT & COLLABORATE

I'm currently looking for opportunities where I can push the boundaries of **React** and **UI design**. If you're looking for a developer who cares about the user as much as the code, let’s talk.
